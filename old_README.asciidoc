== About

The flasher is an application for systems based on the Hilscher "netX" CPU. It writes data to flash or EEPROM chips.

The flasher is a stand-alone application. This means it does not require an OS like Linux, WindowsCE or the netX specific rcX.
It's main use is writing bootable images to SPI or parallel flashes, but it can also be used to:

 * write flashdisk images or application specific data
 * erase a bootable image
 * read the contents of a flash device
